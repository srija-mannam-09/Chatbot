# Chatbot

**Chatbot Development:**

Created a user-friendly chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).
Text Processing Techniques:

**Implemented tokenization and preprocessing methods for input text.**

Utilized keyword matching to generate responses, improving the chatbot's understanding of diverse user queries.
Efficiency Enhancement:

Integration of tokenization and preprocessing techniques significantly enhanced the chatbot's efficiency in handling user inputs.

**TF-IDF Approach:**

Applied the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach in the chatbot.
TF-IDF is a numerical statistic used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
Cosine Similarity:

Incorporated cosine similarity as part of the chatbot's response generation process.
Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors, providing a metric for similarity between documents.

**Response Generation Enhancement:**

TF-IDF and cosine similarity techniques were leveraged to refine and enhance the generation of chatbot responses.
Resulted in more contextually relevant and accurate replies to user queries.

**Diverse User Queries:**

Designed the chatbot to cater to a wide range of user queries effectively.
Ensured that the chatbot could handle different input styles and topics.

**User Experience Improvement:**

Focused on creating a positive user experience by making the chatbot responsive and capable of providing meaningful responses.
